#### Experience
```Jio Platforms Limited
Duration: Oct 2023 - Present
Mode: On-site
Description:
- Developed advanced RAG systems for Jio products like JioFiber, JioRoaming, HR Assistant, and Data Curio, using prompt engineering, LLMs, embeddings, and vector databases. Delivered full pipeline solutions from data ingestion to model deployment, focusing on safe AI practices and optimizing retrieval performance.
- Built custom automation tools such as a PDF data extraction system for efficient RAG data preparation and a JSON debugger to streamline and automate manual processes, improving overall productivity and accuracy.
- Led development of knowledge graphs and Langraph integrations, working on API integrations for seamless data flow between systems. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deploy scalable models, leveraging Docker for containerization and ensuring efficient production environments.
- Contributed to AI innovations by leading projects on pipeline optimization, model evaluation, and AI safety. Played a key role in hosting models, enhancing model performance, and ensuring compliance with safety standards for real-world applications.

#### Projects
```
1. Jio Fiber and Jio International Roaming AI Chatbot
Built a robust retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system from scratch,
managing everything from data processing to deployment. Processed FAQs
and numerical plan data, applied chunking strategies, and generated
embeddings with open-source models, storing them in Milvus. Developed a
pipeline that retrieves relevant data, handles follow-up questions using chat
history, and rephrases queries for accuracy. Enhanced accuracy with
Reciprocal Rank Fusion and advanced prompt engineering (Llama3,
Mistral). Solved hallucination and jailbreaking issues, implemented
feedback loops, and evaluated performance using Uptrain, monitored via
Langfuse.

2. Jio HR Assistant
Developed a RAG system to handle employee HR queries within Jio's
internal app. Built a custom tool to convert complex PDF data, including
tables, into markdown format, significantly improving the bot's accuracy
through proper chunking and markdown splitters. Ingested the processed
data into a vector database and implemented advanced retrieval strategies
with re-ranking and rank fusion. Created feedback-driven answer
reconstruction based on user information, ensuring personalized responses.
Evaluated performance using Uptrain and monitored results through
Langfuse.

3. Data Curio
A project aimed at converting natural language queries into Hive queries.
Worked on improving query generation for a system that converts natural
language into Hive queries. Implemented a feedback prompt to help users
understand why a query couldn’t be generated and guide them in making
necessary adjustments. Created a custom JSON debugger to handle large
datasets, automatically identifying errors and suggesting corrections, and
ingested the processed data into MongoDB.

4. Also worked on Azure DataBricks and other agentic framework lik magentic one of microsoft.
